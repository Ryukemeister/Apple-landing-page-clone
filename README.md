# [Think different !](https://www.apple.com/)

I wanted to put my skills to the test by cloning an existing website on the internet, and what better place to do so than the [Apple website](https://www.apple.com/) ? The images and typography, in my opinion, are what make the website stand out, and this is what convinced me to clone it. But, boy, was I mistaken; there was a lot more to it than the images and the slick typefaces. It required a fair amount of JavaScript, ranging from the Intersection Observer API to event bubbling and a very cool slider that almost brought me to a halt. But I'm glad I was able to finish it after all the efforts that I put into it. And after all of my work, I'm delighted I was able to complete it. Below is a link to that page, hope you like it !
